This project demonstrates how to integrate **Azure AI Services** (Chat Completion, Speech-to-Text, and Text Embeddings) into a Streamlit application. The app provides a simple interface to interact with these services, showcasing their capabilities in real-time.

---

## Features  

1. **Chat Completion**: Interact with Azure OpenAI's GPT-based chat completion models to generate responses for user queries.  
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Upload an audio file and transcribe it into text using Azure's Whisper Speech-to-Text service.  
3. **Text Embeddings**: Generate text embeddings using Azure OpenAI to analyze or compare textual data.

    AZURE_ENDPOINT = "https://your-chat-endpoint.azure.com/openai/deployments/chat/completions"
    WHISPER_API = "your-whisper-api-key"
    WHISPER_ENDPOINT = "https://your-whisper-endpoint.azure.com/endpoint"
    EMBED_API = "your-embed-api-key"
    EMBED_ENDPOINT = "https://your-embed-endpoint.azure.com/embeddings"
   ```
4. Run
  ```bash
      streamlit run 01-task.py
  ```

## Usage Instructions  

### 1. Chat Completion
